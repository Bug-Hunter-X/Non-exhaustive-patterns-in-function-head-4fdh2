The following Haskell code attempts to use the `head` function on an empty list, which results in a runtime error:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let emptyList = []
  let headOfList = head emptyList
  print headOfList
```

This will produce a runtime error because `head` is undefined for empty lists.
